# Hotel_Management_System

Final Year Group Project.

The Hotel Management System is a new self-contained software product which will be produced by 
the project team in order to overcome the problems that have occurred due to the current manual 
system. The newly introduced system will provide an easy access to the system and it will contain 
user friendly functions with attractive interfaces. The system will give better options for the problem 
of handling large scale of physical file system, for the errors occurring in calculations and all the other 
required tasks that has been specified by the client. The final outcome of this project will increase the 
efficiency of almost all the tasks done at the Hotel in a much convenient manner.
